About Me:
## Hi there 👋<br><br><br>About Me 👩🏼‍💻<br><br>Hi! I'm **Yesenia Dávalos**, a passionate **Frontend Developer** with a strong background in **Creative Design** and a recent dive into the world of **programming**. I started my career as a Creative Designer in the textile industry, where I worked for **10 years**. My passion for transforming ideas into visual experiences has always driven me, but I found a new creative spark in **UX/UI Design**. After spending a year working on real-world projects in this field, I decided to take my skills further and began studying **frontend web development** at **Laboratoria**.<br><br>During my journey, I’ve worked on projects that combine my design expertise with technical skills. Currently, I’m diving deep into **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and component-based development. I love continuously challenging myself and ventured into the fascinating world of **programming** to create digital experiences that truly make an impact.<br><br>I’m a **proactive** and **positive** person, always looking for ways to adapt and learn quickly. Every new project is an opportunity to improve, collaborate with others, and create digital products that matter. 💻✨<br><br>You can find me on **LinkedIn** or contact me at **yeseniadavalos27@gmail.com**. ✨🚀<br><br>I'm excited to keep growing and contribute to the world of web development!<br><br>
